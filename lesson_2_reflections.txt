What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- it creates a .git file for that directory, allowing you to
track the versions of that directory (all its files)

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- The staging area is essentially a bridge between the working 
directory and the repository. It allows you to choose
which files you are going to commit rather than having to
commit the entire repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
- The staging area allows you to compare differences before
committing anything, so you can double check that you are not
making too many changes.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
- If you ever need to create a different version of your 
program (i.e. new language or production mode).

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
- Since there can be many branches in one project, being
able to visualize how they fit together, as well as which ones
are parents to others will help you see where the project is.
